## Setting up the Frontend

Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory of the project.

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install the necessary npm modules using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the necessary dependencies.

3. To start the frontend development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server. You can now view the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (the default port of vue, or whatever port you have configured by using `--port [num]`).
